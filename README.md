# Falcon
A fast, powerful, and flexible C++ Game Engine built on top of SDL.

# Setup
Falcon should work out of the box for MacOSX and Linux. See [MinGW Setup](./MINGWSETUP.md) for setting up Falcon on Windows.

## Disclaimer
I am in no way stating that I created the SDL library and simply using it
within my software.
